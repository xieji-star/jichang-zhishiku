# Visual Analysis Method

Use this method before every generation. It deconstructs the source, distills its essential evidence, and reconstructs that evidence as a new nonliteral composition while separating content reasoning from surface styling.

## 0. Lock the three-stage method

- **Deconstruct:** record source evidence in normalized coordinates so its original relationships are understood.
- **Abstract/distill:** rank that evidence, remove literal appearance and redundant detail, and convert retained facts into minimal marks.
- **Reconstruct:** build a new composition from those marks. Preserve relational invariants but do not trace the source layout or recreate a miniature scene.
- Record every deliberate displacement, compression, separation, overlap, or scale change and state which source relationship it clarifies.
- Reject both arbitrary symbol arrangements and one-to-one stylized redraws.

## 1. Rank distinctive evidence

List candidate elements and score each informally on four questions:

- **Recognition:** Would removing it make this photograph less identifiable?
- **Structural influence:** Does it organize the composition or other elements?
- **Contrast:** Does it stand out by size, color, brightness, isolation, or repetition?
- **Specificity:** Is it particular to this image rather than generic scenery?

Choose one primary element. Choose zero to two secondary relationships. Background detail is not automatically evidence.

## 2. Record visual variables

For each selected element, record only observable facts:

| Variable | Record |
|---|---|
| Identity | Neutral description, without invented story or place |
| Shape | Circle, arc, block, taper, contour, silhouette, irregular mass, etc. |
| Count | Exact small count, approximate large count, or meaningful groups |
| Position | Normalized x/y location or clear relative placement |
| Scale | Fraction of frame or ratio to the primary element |
| Color | 3–5 sampled color roles, their approximate dominance, and which observable facts they identify |
| Direction | Facing, tilt, flow, motion, gaze, or axis angle |
| Depth | Near/middle/far order and corresponding scale or lightness changes |
| Rhythm | Spacing, clusters, gaps, repetition, alternation, convergence |
| Relation | Overlap, enclosure, support, reflection, alignment, framing, occlusion |

Do not infer invisible information. Record uncertainty when an edge or count is ambiguous.

## 3. Find the recognition threshold

Ask: what is the smallest set of marks that still preserves this image's distinctive structure?

- Preserve high-information variables first: position, scale ratio, count group, dominant curve or axis, direction, and source-derived accent roles.
- Collapse texture, ornament, background noise, and minor objects.
- Sample dense populations rather than reproducing literal counts, but preserve density distribution and flow.
- Keep exact counts when the count itself is distinctive and small.
- Prefer empty space over a low-information mark.
- Preserve enough distinctive relationships that the lower result reads as an abstract memory of this exact photograph, not a generic icon or a miniature scene.

## 4. Build the mark mapping

Map source evidence to marks explicitly:

- mass or field -> flat irregular block or quiet color plane;
- compact object -> dot, circle, pill, or tiny silhouette;
- boundary or horizon -> one thin line;
- direction or motion -> streak, taper, aligned bars, or directional sequence;
- repeated object -> repeated module with preserved size and interval hierarchy;
- radial structure -> arc plus selected spokes and nodes;
- enclosure or occlusion -> nested or overlapping shapes without completing hidden content;
- reflection or shadow -> shortened, lighter echo aligned to its source.

One mark may encode several related variables. Avoid multiple marks that repeat the same fact.

## 5. Write the abstraction plan

Complete this worksheet before generation:

```text
PRIMARY EVIDENCE
- Locked current user-upload path (`USER_PHOTO`):
- Element:
- Why distinctive:
- Shape / count / position / scale / color / direction:

DECONSTRUCTION
- Major source fields and axes:
- Dominant masses, counts, intervals, gaps, directions, overlaps, and depth order:
- Color roles and meaningful negative space:

RECONSTRUCTION
- Relational invariants that must survive:
- Elements to compress, displace, separate, overlap, or rescale:
- Reason each transformation clarifies the source evidence:
- Confirm the result will not reproduce a miniature scene:

STRUCTURAL EVIDENCE
- Main axis or field:
- Spatial rhythm, gaps, depth, overlap, or motion:

MARK MAPPING
1. Source fact -> mark + relative placement + relative size
2. Source fact -> mark + relative placement + relative size
3. Source fact -> mark + relative placement + relative size

REMOVE
- Details intentionally omitted:

NON-NEGOTIABLE RELATIONSHIPS
- Relationships the generated result must preserve:
- Confirm every reconstruction change preserves a named source relationship and is not arbitrary:

REFERENCE STYLE PLAN
- Selected bundled references (3–4):
- Lower-panel traits borrowed from each:
- Confirm bundled references supply style only and locked `USER_PHOTO` supplies all content:

COLOR EMPHASIS
- Sampled source color roles and approximate dominance:
- Distinct source facts assigned to each accent role:
- Confirm no color was invented merely for variety:

LAYOUT BUDGET
- Reconstructed motif target width: 30–42% of lower-panel width
- Reconstructed motif maximum height: 28% of lower-panel height
- Target visual empty space: 75–88%
- Confirm the complete motif is scaled as one coherent group without changing internal relationships:
- Photo/lower-panel split chosen for this source:
- Motif width as a percentage of lower-panel width (25–50%, up to 60% for structurally wide sources):
- Estimated empty space (65–85%):
- Motif position and slight asymmetric offset, if any:
- Sequential archive number:
- Date source and formatted date:
- Short English atmosphere phrase (1–3 words):
- Empty corner selected for the two-line archive information:
- Surface mode: CLEAN only
- Source integrity: confirm `USER_PHOTO` is the file uploaded in the current request
- Composition: confirm the first finalizer argument is exactly the locked `USER_PHOTO` path
```

## 6. Validate the abstraction

Check the result without relying on mood or polish:

- Can every major mark be pointed back to a source fact?
- Is the primary element still primary by position, scale, contrast, or isolation?
- Are count groups, directions, intervals, gaps, asymmetry, and depth relationships preserved?
- Has the model invented symmetry, equal spacing, missing anatomy, landmarks, text, or narrative?
- Would removing another mark improve clarity without losing recognition?
- Does it resemble this particular photograph's structure rather than a generic subject icon?
- Does the reconstruction preserve relational identity without tracing the source aspect ratio or exact coordinates?
- Can every displacement, compression, separation, overlap, and scale change be justified by source evidence?
- Does it look like a new abstract composition rather than a miniature scene or converted visual style?
- Does the complete reconstructed motif stay within 30–42% of panel width and at most 28% of panel height?
- Does the smaller motif retain its internal hierarchy, spacing, directions, overlaps, and asymmetry as one coherent group?
- Were the required number, date, and phrase reserved for deterministic finalization rather than generated into the artwork?
- Is the lower panel spacious enough, with the motif inside its planned responsive envelope and 65–85% of its area left empty?
- Is the sequential `NO. 00X` label present in the upper-right of the lower panel, extremely small and unobtrusive?
- Are there exactly two additional tiny archive lines in another empty corner: a factual `DD MON YYYY` date and a 1–3 word uppercase English phrase derived from the image?
- Do different accent colors correspond to different source facts while preserving the source's saturation, luminance hierarchy, and approximate dominance?
- Does their placement balance the motif without using text as decorative filler?
- In CLEAN mode, does side-by-side comparison confirm unchanged exposure, white balance, saturation, black level, highlight brightness, local contrast, sharpness, and noise profile?
- Was the abstract panel kept as an unreturned intermediate, then finalized with the full-frame, uncropped original and a `DELIVERY PASS` from `finalize_artwork.py`?
- Are the photograph and lower field free of newly introduced visible grain, speckles, stains, haze, yellow or gray cast, and cumulative generation artifacts?
- Do sampled empty areas at the center, sides, and corners share one uniform neutral-ivory RGB value, with no gradient, band, patch, seam, glow, shadow, or separate text-area field?

If any answer fails, revise the mapping before adjusting color, texture, or typography.
