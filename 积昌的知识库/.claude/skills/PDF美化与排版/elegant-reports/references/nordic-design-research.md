# Nordic Design Research for Elegant Reports

## Core Principles of Scandinavian Design

### Philosophy
From Wikipedia and ArchDaily research:

> "Scandinavian design is characterized by **simplicity, minimalism, and functionality**. It emerged in the early 20th century and flourished in the 1950s across Denmark, Finland, Norway, Sweden, and Iceland."

> "The Scandinavian approach is one of **subtle and precise intervention**. These projects are not meant to dominate but to enter into a **dialogue** with the existing context."

### The 6 Pillars (ArchDaily "6 Lessons from Scandinavian Design")

1. **Simplicity** — Remove unnecessary elements; every component must earn its place
2. **Craftsmanship** — Quality over quantity; attention to detail
3. **Elegant Functionality** — Form follows function, but function can be beautiful
4. **Quality Materials** — Natural, honest materials that age gracefully
5. **Hygge** — Creating coziness and contentment; psychological comfort
6. **Light** — Deliberate use of light as a design element (especially important in dark Nordic winters)

### "Less, but Better" (Dieter Rams / Ace Hotel)
- Economy of materials
- Lack of information overload
- Well-studied dimensions
- Sophistication in details, not decoration

## Visual Language

### Color Palette

**Primary: Neutral Foundation**
Based on Refactoring UI and Tailwind research, a Nordic palette needs:

- **9-11 shades of gray** (not just 3-4)
- **Warm neutrals** preferred over cold grays (stone/slate tones)
- **One accent color** used sparingly (typically muted blue, teal, or forest green)

**Recommended Nordic Palette:**

```
Background:    #FAFAFA (off-white, warmer than pure white)
Surface:       #FFFFFF (cards, elevated elements)
Border:        #E5E5E5 (subtle, low contrast)
Text Primary:  #171717 (not pure black — softer)
Text Secondary:#737373 (muted, accessible)
Text Tertiary: #A3A3A3 (captions, timestamps)
Accent:        #0EA5E9 (sky-500, Nordic blue)
Accent Muted:  #7DD3FC (sky-300, lighter touch)
```

**Dark Mode Equivalent:**
```
Background:    #0A0A0A
Surface:       #171717
Border:        #262626
Text Primary:  #FAFAFA
Text Secondary:#A3A3A3
Text Tertiary: #737373
Accent:        #38BDF8
```

### Typography

**Geist (Vercel) — Primary Recommendation**
> "Specifically designed for developers and designers... embodies principles of simplicity, minimalism, and speed, drawing inspiration from the Swiss design movement."

**Font Stack Options (Nordic feel):**

1. **Geist** — Modern Swiss-inspired, excellent for tech
2. **Inter** — Designed for screens, highly legible, open source
3. **IBM Plex Sans** — Corporate but warm, excellent for reports
4. **DM Sans** — Clean, geometric, friendly
5. **Source Sans Pro** — Adobe's workhorse, very readable

**Monospace:**
- Geist Mono
- JetBrains Mono
- IBM Plex Mono

**Recommended Pairings:**
- Headers: Inter (600-700 weight)
- Body: Inter (400 weight)
- Code/Data: Geist Mono or JetBrains Mono

### Spacing & Layout

**Generous Whitespace**
- Nordic design uses **more whitespace** than typical Western design
- Let elements breathe
- Use consistent spacing scale (4, 8, 12, 16, 24, 32, 48, 64, 96px)

**Grid System**
From Vercel's design: "A huge part of the new Vercel aesthetic" is the grid
- Use subtle grid lines as design elements
- 12-column grid for flexibility
- Generous margins (32-48px minimum on reports)

### Visual Rhythm (from Rauno.me/Vercel)

> "For a consistent rhythm, we made deliberate effort not to overuse any single design motif. Subconsciously, we also made use of white space for a consistent rhythm."

- **High-novelty elements** (bold colors, motion, decoration) should never appear consecutively
- **Interlude** (whitespace, neutral elements) between attention-grabbing sections
- Balance visual density across the page

## Report-Specific Design Patterns

### Information Hierarchy

1. **Title** — Large, bold, minimal (32-48px)
2. **Metadata** — Small, muted, separated (date, author — 12-14px)
3. **Summary/Abstract** — Prominent but not competing with title
4. **Section Headers** — Clear but understated (20-24px, medium weight)
5. **Body Text** — Comfortable reading size (16-18px, 1.6 line-height)
6. **Data/Tables** — Slightly smaller, monospace numbers (14-15px)

### Tables (Nordic Style)

```css
/* No heavy borders — use background alternation and spacing */
table {
  border-collapse: separate;
  border-spacing: 0;
}

th {
  text-align: left;
  font-weight: 500; /* Not bold */
  color: #737373;   /* Muted */
  text-transform: uppercase;
  font-size: 11px;
  letter-spacing: 0.05em;
  padding: 12px 16px;
  border-bottom: 1px solid #E5E5E5;
}

td {
  padding: 12px 16px;
  border-bottom: 1px solid #F5F5F5; /* Very subtle */
}

tr:hover {
  background: #FAFAFA; /* Subtle hover */
}
```

### Cards & Containers

- **Minimal shadows** — `box-shadow: 0 1px 3px rgba(0,0,0,0.08)`
- **Subtle borders** preferred over shadows for light mode
- **Rounded corners** — 8px (not too round, not sharp)
- **No gradients** on backgrounds (flat, honest colors)

### Charts & Data Visualization

From Atlassian's color guidance:
- Use a **restrained palette** for charts (3-5 colors max)
- **Accessible contrast** — 3:1 minimum for data elements
- Labels directly on/near data points (reduce cognitive load)
- No 3D effects, minimal decoration

Recommended chart colors (muted, distinguishable):
```
#0EA5E9 — Sky blue (primary)
#8B5CF6 — Violet (secondary)
#10B981 — Emerald (positive)
#F59E0B — Amber (warning)
#EF4444 — Red (alert)
#64748B — Slate (neutral)
```

## Laws of UX Applied to Reports

From lawsofux.com, key principles for report design:

### Aesthetic-Usability Effect
> "Users often perceive aesthetically pleasing design as design that's more usable."

Beautiful reports are perceived as more credible and easier to understand.

### Miller's Law
> "The average person can only keep 7 (plus or minus 2) items in their working memory."

- Limit key metrics per section to 5-7 items
- Use chunking for large data sets
- Executive summaries should have 3-5 key points

### Law of Prägnanz
> "People perceive complex images as the simplest form possible."

- Simple, clean layouts are processed faster
- Avoid visual complexity that requires interpretation

### Serial Position Effect
> "Users best remember the first and last items."

- Put most important information at the beginning
- End with clear conclusions or next steps

---

## Template Variations

### 1. Executive Summary (1-page)
- Large hero metric or finding
- 3-5 key points with icons
- Minimal text, maximum impact
- Single accent color for emphasis

### 2. Detailed Analysis
- Table of contents
- Clear section hierarchy
- Data tables and charts
- Footnotes and sources

### 3. Metrics Dashboard
- KPI cards at top
- Comparison charts
- Trend indicators
- Dense but organized data

### 4. Meeting Notes / Status Update
- Date and attendees prominent
- Action items highlighted
- Simple bullet formatting
- Quick-scan friendly

### 5. Technical/API Documentation
- Code blocks with syntax highlighting
- Monospace for technical content
- Clear parameter tables
- Dark mode friendly

## Implementation Notes

### PDF-Specific Considerations

1. **Page breaks** — Use `page-break-before: always` for major sections
2. **Headers/Footers** — Page numbers, date, document title
3. **Print colors** — Ensure sufficient contrast when printed B&W
4. **Font embedding** — Use web fonts with proper licensing (Google Fonts)
5. **A4 vs Letter** — Support both with proper margins

### CSS Print Optimization
```css
@media print {
  body { -webkit-print-color-adjust: exact; }
  .no-print { display: none; }
  h1, h2, h3 { page-break-after: avoid; }
  table, figure { page-break-inside: avoid; }
}
```
